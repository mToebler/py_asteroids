# globals & constants
# Most of the constants have been moved to their respective Class files.
# If a constant portained to only one class, I am thinking it belongs in 
# that class as a Class property or attribute (a final static class variable).
# What's left here are those system-wide values that don't fit one class, 
# but all of them (some of these belong in Games tho.).
